# Choropleth-map-of-Mask-Wearing-Frequency
The map is created via Tableau based on the data collected from New York Times to estimate the mask usage by county in the United States in July 2020 during Covid-19 period 
# Data Overview
"This data comes from a large number of interviews conducted online by the global data and survey firm Dynata at the request of The New York Times. The firm asked a question about mask use to obtain 250,000 survey responses between July 2 and July 14, enough data to provide estimates more detailed than the state level. (Several states have imposed new mask requirements since the completion of these interviews.)

Specifically, each participant was asked: How often do you wear a mask in public when you expect to be within six feet of another person?"
